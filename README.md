# File Manager
A file manager made with only text! How amazing! So far, you can only look at the folders and files... but I hope to make it so you can open and change files!

## Controls
### Up + Down Arrows
- Used to navigate between folders and files.

### Enter
- Used to open a `folder` not file.

### Backspace
- Used to exit a folder. `(Will crash if you go too far back.)`
